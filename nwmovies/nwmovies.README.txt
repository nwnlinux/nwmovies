NWMovies is inteded to be a solution to a minor "missing movie" deficiency 
in the Linx NWN client.  

Long story short:  It puts the movies back into the Linux client just like
they are on the Windows clients.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Acknowledgments: 

My thanks to Bioware for supporting NWN on the Linux platform. 

The Linux NWN community members for their support, specifically Skildron, 
Eyrdan, Benjamin 'Asaru' Dirks, JonSvenJonsson, Eljar, Hesham Hassan, 
Azlinon, Urban Widmark, gjj, and Daniel Andrade.

If I've forgotten anyone my apologies, its been a long time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

NWMovies now includes pre-built binary modules. They were built on a Gentoo
system.  If they work for you (and you trust they're what I claim them to
be) there is no longer any need to build NWMovies from source.

You will still however need at a minimum, Perl and the FFMpeg ffplay media 
player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building from Source requirements: 

gcc, Perl, libelf, and full development headers. 

If you are building on x86_64, you will need to install the appropriate
32bit versions of your development libraries. NWN is a 32bit application,
and the 64bit versions of development libraries installed by default are 
of no use. 

Also note building 32bit binaries on a 64bit x86_64 OS is often considered 
"hard" and not a trivial exercise.

The "nwmovies_install.pl" script can be used to build the source as well.

"./nwmovies_install.pl build" will NWMovies from source code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cleanup pre-instructions:

#) Remove any old versions of NWMovies, with a simple 

	cd (NWN install location)
 	rm -rf nwmovies* 

#) If you are using nwuser, and installed NWMovies in your home directory, 
be certain to remove any NWMovies related files in your home directory as well. 

	rm -rf $HOME/.nwn/nwmovies*
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation instructions: 

*) Unpack the tarball in your NWN directory

	cd (NWN install location)
	gzip -dc nwmovies-(version).tar.gz | tar xvf - 

*) Execute "nwmovies_install.pl" to check a few known sound card
things. 

 	./nwmovies_install.pl 

This will check a few odds and ends and hopefully give you some clues about
how your sound subsystem is configured.  *Note: This does not check
the new PulseAudio sound system at this point. 

If you wish to build remove from source, execute "./nwmovies_install.pl build"
and it will attempt to build NWMovies from source as well as check 
some sound card configuration.

See "nwmovies.README.soundcards.txt" for further documentation, and
suggestions.

*) Download and install FFMpeg (or libav).

This should be available for all Linux distributions as a native package.
Note for FFMpeg versions earlier than 1.1, bug 1935 caused Bink movies not
to automatically exit at their end so just press any key or mouse button
to exit the movie player as normal.

*) Install your movies.    

The movies should go in the "movies" directory under the main NWN
directory.  They should be on your NWN CD's somewhere.  The exact location
varies depending on the particular version of NWN you bought.  They may
also be in one of the "Language_data" ZIP files in the case of standalone
SOU/HOTU.

I believe this is the default collection of movies:

uholld1@crusader:~/nwn/movies$ ls *.bik
AtariLogo.bik    credits.bik         prelude_chap1.bik    XP1_Intro.bik
BiowareLogo.bik  ending.bik          WOTCLogo.bik         XP2_Intro.bik
Chap1_Chap2.bik  fge_logo_black.bik  XP1_Chap1_Chap2.bik
Chap2_Chap3.bik  NWNintro.bik        XP1_Chap2_Chap3.bik
Chap3_Chap4.bik  prelude.bik         XP1_Closing.bik


*) Modify the 'nwn' startup script to include the following line: 

	export LD_PRELOAD=./nwmovies.so

Before it executes "./nwmain"

Also note, the libSDL included with NWN is horribly old, and tends to cause
problems on newer systems (from xcb_lock issues to no sound) so you may
wish to edit the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting in 'nwn' as well to remove the 
"./lib:" entry.

*) Run NWN.
 
	./nwn

If you have edited the nwn script appropriately, the first time you run
NWN, NWMovies will build the INI file, and then exit.   This is normal.
The second run of NWN will execute normally. 

*) Run NWN a second time. 

This time NWN should start up, and play the movies properly.  You should
be able to hit "escape" to abort a playing movie.  

The screen does flicker at the beginning and end of a movie. There are long
term supportability issues involved, but there is an environment variables 
you can set that may help remove it.

The 'Movies' button at the NWN main menu should work.

The only known bug is the music at the main menu does not work when you
first enter NWN.  Entering the game, and then quitting back to the main
menu causes the music to start working.  There is no known reason for
this.   The button click sound howver works normally. 

If you do not have any sound at all in either NWN, or in the movies, you
possibly have a single PCM channel sound card and may need to look into
your audio software mixing options see the 'nwmovies.README.soundcard.txt'
for further documentation.

Further Documentation: 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skipping specific movies: 

If you wish to skip specific movies, while leaving others enabled to be 
played.  You've two options. 

You can delete the movie.  If a movie is missing NWMovies obviously can't
play it. 

If you can't delete (or don't want to delete) the movie (as might occur
when using NWUser), you can place the title of the movie(s) in a 
'nwmovies.skip' file. One title per line.   The titles are not case 
sensitive, "AtariLogo" works just as well as "atarilogo".

The file must be placed in either in the top level nwn directory, or in 
$HOME/.nwn/nwmovies.skip 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Screen Flickering at movie beginning/end: 

Per code inside of libSDL, libSDL enforces fullscreen applications to
maintain a keyboard, and mouse grab, so that other applications cannot
interfere with the fullscreen application.  

The only officially supported way to disable that grab, is to toggle the 
fullscreen state of the window.  NWMovies toggles the NWN fullscreen state
off at movie start, and toggles the fullscreen state back on at movie end.  
That toggling is the source of the screen flickers. 

However, you may enable a hack in NWMovies that manipulates internal libSDL 
state, to make libSDL believe NWN is not a fullscreen application. If
libSDL believes NWN is not a fullscreen application, the normal grab
release mechanisms work, and NWMovies does not need to toggle the fulscreen
state of the the NWN window. 

To enable this hack add the following line to your 'nwn' startup script. 

	export NWMOVIES_GRAB_HACK=1

This is not enabled by default as it manipulates internal libSDL state,
and maybe broken at any time by the libSDL developers. However, since SDL
2.0 has been released and SDL 1.2 is now in maintenance mode, this is now
unlikely and it is safe to use this hack.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changing media player:

To change the media player from the default settings, add the following
example line to your 'nwn' startup script and adjust to desired
preferences.

	export NWMOVIES_PLAY_COMMAND="command -options"

The movie filename is appended to the command.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional variables:

The 'nwmovies_install.pl' script recognizes the CC, CFLAGS, and LDFLAGS
when building NWMovies from source.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Log files: 

There is a bit of a log file in 'nwmovies.log'. If you do run into issues 
hopefully between the output NWMovies displays at startup, and the contents 
of the log file, any issues will be easily identifiable, and quickly
resolveable. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other issues: 

Please feel free to contact me via the Bioware forums, or at my gmail.com 
address with questions, comments, issues, etc.  

Flames will be redirected to /dev/null.   As will testy bug reports.  
Friendly bug reports will be examined as time permits. 

I won't guarantee that I can solve any, and all problems but I will at
least attempt to as my time permits. 

I will at the very minimum need the output NWMovies displays when starting
NWN, and possibly the output of the 'nwmovies.log' file. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known Issues/Bugs/Comments: 

The main menu music does not work after starting NWN w/ NWMovies.
Entering the game, and backing out to the main menu, the music works.
Known issue, no known cause, nor resolution.
