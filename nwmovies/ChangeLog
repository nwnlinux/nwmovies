START 06/14/13 Notes.

Use internal parsing instead of calling external nwinstall.pl script. On 64-bit
systems when using NWUser, as the 32-bit nwuser.so cannot be preloaded by
64-bit commands and movie playing then fails due to permission denied while
trying to write logfile in game directory rather than user directory.

Switch to using ffplay from FFMpeg as it now supports Bink videos natively
along with fullscreen scaling.

Add "NWMOVIES_PLAY_COMMAND" enviroment variable to change player and options.

END 06/14/13 Notes

START 02/23/09 Notes. 

Modify the method used by the preload to load libSDL, as based on some
patches by Daniel Andrade.  

More specifically, try RTLD_NEXT to dlsym(), and if that fails, manually 
load the libSDL-1.2.so.0 library, and then use it to find the necessary
symbols. 

I guess this has been in beta long enough, call it a release, and be 
done with it. 

END 02/23/09 Notes. 

START 05/09/08 Notes. 

Version 4.0 Release

No more dependancy on knowning which version of libSDL before hand, the 
preload should use ld.so to load the libSDL library used, and go from 
there. 

No more patching libSDL for the fullscreen toggle.

No more patching libSDL for nwmovies to work.

Automatically raise the BinkPlayer window upon movie playback so 
it is not hidden behind the frozen NWN movie. 

Release the mouse and keyboard grab libSDL enforces when NWN is full screen,
during movie playback so you can hit ESC to terminate movie playback. 

Per some sample code from Skildron, enable a method to skip specific movies by
placing the movie name in a 'nwmovies.skip' file. 

Disable the mouse cursor during movie playback. (Also by Skildron.)

START 05/XX/06 Notes.

AMD x86_64 updates.  NWMovies (and friends) should not be a lot
closer to working on 64 bit platforms, thanks to the efforts of
Skildron, and Eyrdan on the NWN forums.  They supplied patches, and
I adapted them into a build framework, and made certain nothing
blew up on 32bit.

My thanks to them!

Note: You will need to install the appropriate 32bit devel packages
for your distribution.   

Due to the heavy use of LD_PRELOAD (and some (IMO) stupidity on Linux's
part) you'll occasionally see errors out of ld.so stating that
libraries can't be preloaded.  I've tried to minimize them, but
until the concept of LD_PRELOAD32/LD_PRELOAD64 is implimented,
you'll just have to cope.

ex:
ERROR: ld.so: object './nwmovies/binklib.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
ERROR: ld.so: object './nwmovies/binklib.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.

See the bottom of nwmovies.README.softmix.txt for quicky instructions on 
rebuilding a 32bit libSDL.  (As well as some settings if your Sound card
does not support multiple simultaneous opens.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
START 01/10/06 Notes. 

Wow, no updates at all in 2005. 

This update is primarily due to the excellent detective work of 
Benjamin 'Asaru' Dirks. 

He located the bit of code that was disabling the Movies button on 
the MainMenu.   It has now been "fixed" and works properly.

Many thanks to him!

Also note, I've modified the build/installation to require the
libSDL path, as it seems with the newer distro's everyone was 
needing to do it anyways.    

If your not using the Bioware provided libSDL, and NWMovies spits out: 

WARNING: NWMovies: SDL_WM_GrabInputRaw() not visible.  Looking for it the hard way.
WARNING: NWMovies: This may not work.

Then NWN crashes at the first movie, then NWMovies lookup didn't work. 

The simplest fix is to build a newer libSDL with the fullscreen patches on my
site.  Its not as complicated as it looks, and if you can build NWMovies successfully,
your likely to be able to rebuild libSDL successfully. 

Updated the nwmovies.pl script to prefer BinkPlayer, if this is a problem read
the comments at the top of the script, and comment out the first binkplayer 
setting.

I also re-ordered these 'Notes'. :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
START 06/24/04 Notes.

Removed a #include <linux/user.h> forget the original reason it was
needed. (Probably its from some example code I found when 
writing this.) - Eitherway, it appears to be unnecessary, and was
causing issues. 

Also from a post by JonSvenJonsson, for the users who have 
issues w/ NWMovies playing the video correctly, but no sound in the
w/ the movies, please see the 'nwmovies.README.softmix.txt" text file.
(It has ALSA settings, and (short) libSDL rebuild instructions) 

And thirdly, w/ current NVidia drivers, NWN _DOES_ work in 
16-bit display depth mode. (65535 colors) However, BinkPlayer,
when used under NWMovies, gives strange colors.  BinkPlayer works 
fine in 16bit mode when used stand-alone.  (Go figure). 

The fix is to simply change your display depth to 24bit, (millions of colors).

If NWMovies crashes after attempting to locate SDL_WM_GrabInputRaw()
via the "hard way", in a non-Bioware libSDL, you'll need to rebuild
libSDL w/ the minor static declaration patch mentioned in 
nwmovies.README.softmix.txt. 

Gentoo users may just be able to:  "FEATURES=nostrip emerge libsdl" to 
avoid messing w/ the libSDL code. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
START 05/05/04 Notes. 

1) 
If NWMovies is not working for you, and the only lines in the nwmovies.log
file are of the form: 

./nwmovies.pl AtariLogo >> nwmovies.log 2>&1
./nwmovies.pl BiowareLogo >> nwmovies.log 2>&1
./nwmovies.pl WotcLogo >> nwmovies.log 2>&1
./nwmovies.pl fge_logo_black >> nwmovies.log 2>&1
./nwmovies.pl NWNIntro >> nwmovies.log 2>&1

Make note of the libSDL NWMovies identifies when NWN starts up.  NWMovies
will spit out a line like so: 

NOTICE: SDL Library determined to be: ./lib/libSDL-1.2.so.0

Rebuild NWMovies w/ nwmovies_install.pl, and specify the libSDL mentioned:  

ex:   ./nwmovies_install.pl ./lib/libSDL-1.2.so.0

This rebuilds nwmovies specifying some dependancies that are apparently 
necessary on your system. 

2) Eyrdan reports that NWMovies was not working for him.  Quote, "every
other movie was just a black screen."    

He's using a ATI card, and suggested commenting out the 
'Option "EnablePageFlip" "True"' line in the XFree86 config file. 

(My thanks to him. - Tis good when you can report a fix along w/ a problem. :) ) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
START 04/22/04 Notes
Occasionally the NWN client will switch to windowed mode, after
move playback. If you can, just minimize it, and then restore it to 
get back to full screen mode.

If you cannot minimize the window, you may attempt the new setting inside
the nwmovies.ini file.  (NeedsToggle)

To use this setting, Add the following line. (Or change, if it already exists)

NeedsToggle 1 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
START 10/26/03 Notes: 

No code changes, just a couple of odd bits discovered on the net regarding
NWMovies. 

<quote>
3. Your sound card *MUST* support at least two audio channels, since when it
starts, NWN grabs one and mplayer has to be able to use another. Using ALSA
and the cmipci driver, the only way to do this is to turn off the rear
speakers in the mixer, and have mplayer use the /dev/adsp device in the perl
script. If NWMovies hangs, its probably because it's trying to open /dev/dsp
on a card with only one audio channel.
</quote>

If that means anything to anyone great.  :-) 

Secondly, a user (Eljar) discovered that they couldn't get sound out of NWMovies 
with SuSE 8.2 and ALSA drivers.   It appears that MPlayer couldn't open the audio
device.    They finally got it to work by: 

<quote>
Updated alsa from 0.9.0 to 0.9.8
Updated sdl from 1.2.5 to 1.2.6-1
Updated MPlayer from 0.92 to 1.0pre2

Then NWN started to crash if artsd was running.
So I diabled arts. Still no movie sound. Then I stared
esd (of Gnome) and it all runs nicley (I also run mplayer wit "-ao sdl").
Since I don't normally use esd I added these lines to the
nwn startup script to automate starting it:
Before "./nwmain $@": /usr/bin/esd -nobeeps &
After "./nwmain $@": /usr/bin/killall esd
</quote>

My theory is w/ the first quote, is that their sound card (or driver)
only supports a single output stream.  Using ESD with NWN, and NWMovies
does the sound multiplexing in software, and multiplexes it into a 
single stream, which can then be successfully sent to the sound card. 
It probably increases the CPU utilization of NWN somewhat, but if it 
works...

Perhaps that will be of use to someone. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
START 9/24/03 Notes: 

Minor fix by Hesham Hassan.  

If only .bik movies exist, nwmovies.pl  wouldn't figure out
that they were there, and therefore wouldn't play anything. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
START 9/6/03 Notes: 

More dinking w/ the stripped libSDL SDL_WM_GrabInputRaw() code.
Now uses either the last call, or the last jmp, which ever is 
last. 

Also many thanks to Azlinon for usage of one of his Mandrake
systems to finally track down (hopefully) the last remaining
segfault bug. 

Also change the Mplayer default output device to SDL, due to a 
report that the x11 output device nolonger worked /w the latest
version of Mplayer. 

Also add parsing options to nwmovies.pl to determine screen resolution, 
and scale the played movie to that resolution, so there are fewer
resolution switches during movie playback. 

And added a preference for mpg named files, if using plaympeg.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
START 9/1/03 Notes: 

Per a user requests, this should theoretically work with a stripped 
libSDL.so.0.    (stripped libSDL's don't work real well as 
SDL_WM_GrabInputRaw() is no longer 'visible' )

It works by disassembling SDL_WM_GrabInput() to find the 
last subroutine call.   On libSDL 1.2.5, this is the call to
SDL_WM_GrabInput_Raw().    If SDL were to undergo a significant
change, or perhaps major changes due to optimizer flags this will break. 

If that's the case, well, your stuck, and will have to go back to the
Bioware provided SDL. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
START 8/26/03 Notes: 

1) Applied patches from Urban Widmark.    These patches should help 
those users who were not using GCC-3.2.   It appears my 
assembler is worse than I thought, and was only getting lucky that
things were working at all.   This should help those who
were getting strange crashes after playing the first movie. 

And a recommendation from <someone> to move everything off into its own 
subdirectory.

Many thanks!

2) Dynamic constant calculations.   The code has gotten alot bigger, however
it is no longer hard coded to a specific release.     This is goodness..
As if I were to get hit by a bus tomorrow, and 1.32 to come out the day
after that, NWMovies might have a chance to still work on 1.32 w/ out 
someone coming up with a header file for it. 

Note: The first time you run NWN w/ NWMovies installed, it will calculate
the necessary constants, store them in a 'nwmovies.ini' file, and
then immediately exit.  Please run it a second time to actually get
in the game. 

Note: This code now contains other code based upon: 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/bastard/

I've hacked on the code, (and its a old version), so 
please do not use the code for any other projects. 

A copy of its original license is in ~/nwn/nwmovies/libdis/LICENSE.original.
