This code is originally from: 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/bastard/

(And is apparently an old version.)

The original authors are: 

# mammon_, mere coder
# ReZiDeNt, Militant Dairy Activist
# The Grugq, Chief Makefile Architect
# MO_K, MIA Libi386 Enthusiast
# a_p, Invisible Tester
# fbj, Visible Tester

I've just hacked on it enough to make it spit out the
right opcodes for what I need it to do. 
(They're probably incorrect modifications in a 
general sense.  ERGO: Don't use my modified library
for anything else.)

However, I can recommend this library as a general
disassembler, its got a useful API.  :-) 

The original license is in LICENSE.original.
